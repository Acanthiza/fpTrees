# Methods

## Data collection

##




## Workflow

All data analysis and report writing was done in a single scripted workflow (script file: [`r list.files(here::here(),pattern="Report.Rmd",recursive=TRUE)`](`r paste0("https://github.com/Acanthiza/",project,list.files(here::here(),pattern="t.Rmd",recursive=TRUE))`) using the programs 'R' and 'R-studio'.

[R](https://www.r-project.org/) [@R-base] is an open-source platform which makes available a library of packages that can be used and modified as necessary. [R-studio](https://www.rstudio.com/) provides a range of user-friendly features to facilitate interaction with R. The packages used are listed in the appendix: [R packages used] Table \@ref(tab:packages).

All data, code and outputs are stored in a version control system at [`r project`](`r paste0("https://github.com/Acanthiza/",project,list.files(here::here(),pattern="t.Rmd",recursive=TRUE))`).

## Model

Trend in `r Y` was analysed using a Bayesian generalised linear mixed model. The analysis was run using the rstanarm package [@RN4481] in R [@R-base]. Transect was treated as a random effect in the analysis. Each tree was then assumed to provide an independent data point for the analysis. A time field was generated as $time = min(Year) + (max(Year) - min(Year))/2$. The model specification was:

``r format(formula(mod))``

## Trees

There were `r nrow(datExp)` trees available for analysis (see table below). A map of the Katarapko floodplain including tree locations is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:treesMap).

```{r trees}

  trees <- datExp %>%
    dplyr::mutate(Transect = as.factor(Transect)) %>%
    dplyr::group_by(Species,Transect,HydroGp,Year) %>%
    dplyr::summarise(n = n()
                     , UQ(rlang::sym(Y)) := median(!!ensym(Y))
                     ) %>%
    dplyr::group_by(Species,HydroGp,Year) %>%
    dplyr::summarise(Transects = n()
                     , Trees = sum(n)
                     , `Median value` = median(!!ensym(Y))
                     ) %>%
    dplyr::ungroup()

  datatable(trees
            , filter = "top"
            , extensions = c("Responsive","Buttons")
            , options = list(dom = 'Bfrtip'
                             , buttons = c('copy'
                                           #, 'csv'
                                           #, 'excel'
                                           #, 'pdf'
                                           #, 'print'
                                           )
                             )
            )

```

```{r treesMap, fig.cap = "Tree locations on Katarapko floodplain"}

  tmap_leaflet(
    
    tm_shape(dat) +
      tm_dots(col = "HydroGp"
              , popup.vars = c(Y,"Species","HydroGp","LOCCOMM")
              ) +
      tm_view(bbox = mapBB) +
      tm_scale_bar()
    
  )

# Results

## Diagnostics

### MCMC diagnostics

Figure \@ref(fig:mixing) and Figure \@ref(fig:rhat) provide visualisations for Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) diagnostics after fitting a Bayesian model.

```{r mixing, fig.cap = "Chain mixing. With good mixing there should be no pattern discernable"}

  stan_trace(mod)

```

---

```{r rhat, fig.cap = "Rhat values - a measure of all chains being at the same equilibrium value. These should all be close to 1."}

  plot(mod, "rhat_hist")

```

---

### Model diagnostics

Figure \@ref(fig:yResid) shows residuals plotted against `r Y`. Ideally these residuals will show no pattern - i.e. randomly distributed about zero. However, in this case, at low values of `r Y` the model is under-predicting (negative residuals) while at high values the model is over-predicting (positive residuals).

```{r yResid, fig.cap = "Residuals"}

  # Y vs. residuals
  ggplot(modResid, aes(!!ensym(Y),residual,label=Transect,colour=Transect)) +
    geom_text(size = 2
              #, alpha=0.5
              , position=position_jitter(width=0.3,height=0.2)
              ) +
    geom_hline(aes(yintercept = 0),linetype = 2) +
    facet_grid(Species~HydroGp) +
    scale_colour_viridis_c()

```

---

Figure \@ref(fig:modFit) shows how a subset of the model runs (light blue lines) fits to the original data (dark blue line).

```{r modFit, fig.height = 8, fig.cap = "Model fit"}

  # Model fit
    # Model fit
    a <- pp_check(mod) + coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0,quantile(mod$fitted.values,probs=0.05))) + labs(title = "0-quantile(0.1)")
    b <- pp_check(mod) + coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0,quantile(mod$fitted.values,probs=0.5))) + labs(title = "0-quantile(0.5)")
    c <- pp_check(mod) + coord_cartesian(xlim = c(quantile(mod$fitted.values,probs=0.5),max(mod$fitted.values))) + labs(title = "quantile(0.5)-max")
    d <- pp_check(mod) + labs(title = "0-max pred")
    
    grid.arrange(a,b,c,d)


```

## `r Y`

Table \@ref(tab:valueTab) shows median credible estimates for `r Y`.

Table \@ref(tab:valueCI) shows the 95% credible interval range for `r Y`.

Figure \@ref(fig:valueFig) shows the distribution of credible values for `r Y`.

```{r valueTab}

  kable(modRes %>%
          dplyr::select(Year,HydroGp, Species, modMedian) %>%
          tidyr::spread(Species, modMedian) %>%
          dplyr::arrange(HydroGp,Year)
        , caption = paste0("Median credible value for ",Y)
        )

```

          dplyr::arrange(HydroGp,Year)
        , caption = paste0("95% credible interval range for ",Y)
        )

```

           ) +
      treeColFill +
      theme(axis.text.y = element_text(vjust = 0))

```

## Difference to Group 2

Table \@ref(tab:diffTab) shows the likelihood that Group x has higher `r Y` than Group 2.

Figure \@ref(fig:diffFig) shows the distribution of credible values for the difference between Group x and Group 2.

```{r diffTab}

  kable(modDeltaRes %>%
              dplyr::select(-n) %>%
              dplyr::filter(direction == "Higher") %>%
              dplyr::mutate(prob = round(prob,1)) %>%
              dplyr::select(HydroGp,Year,Species,prob) %>%
              tidyr::spread(Species,prob) %>%
              dplyr::arrange(HydroGp,Year)
              
          , caption = paste0("Likelihood of higher ",Y," in Group x compared to Group 2")
        )

```

---

```{r diffFig, fig.height = 8, fig.cap = paste0("By 2018 there is little difference from Group 2. In Group 3 for all three species, and in Group 5 for RRG, ",Y," was higher than Group 2 prior to 2018 (much stronger for RRG than BB).

  ggplot(modDelta
           , aes(diff
                 , factor(Year)
                 , fill = Species

                          , alpha=0.5
                          , panel_scaling = FALSE
