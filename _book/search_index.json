R (R Core Team 2018) is an open-source platform which makes available a library of packages that can be used and modified as necessary. R-studio provides a range of user-friendly features to facilitate interaction with R. The packages used are listed in the appendix: R packages used Table 4.1. All data, code and outputs are stored in a version control system at fpTrees. 2.4 Model Trend in TCI was analysed using a Bayesian generalised linear mixed model. The analysis was run using the rstanarm package (Stan Development Team 2016) in R (R Core Team 2018). Transect was treated as a random effect in the analysis. Each tree was then assumed to provide an independent data point for the analysis. A time field was generated as \\(time = min(Year) + (max(Year) - min(Year))/2\\). The model specification was: cbind(TCI, 14 - TCI) ~ time * Species * HydroGp + (1 | Transect) 2.5 Trees There were 1729 trees available for analysis (see table below). A map of the Katarapko floodplain including tree locations is shown in Figure 2.1. Figure 2.1: Tree locations on Katarapko floodplain References "],

Figure 3.1: Chain mixing. With good mixing there should be no pattern discernable Figure 3.2: Rhat values - a measure of all chains being at the same equilibrium value. These should all be close to 1. 3.1.2 Model diagnostics Figure 3.3 shows residuals plotted against TCI. Ideally these residuals will show no pattern - i.e. randomly distributed about zero. However, in this case, at low values of TCI the model is under-predicting (negative residuals) while at high values the model is over-predicting (positive residuals). Figure 3.3: Residuals Figure 3.4 shows how a subset of the model runs (light blue lines) fits to the original data (dark blue line). Figure 3.4: Model fit 3.2 TCI Table 3.1 shows median credible estimates for TCI. Table 3.2 shows the 95% credible interval range for TCI. Figure 3.5 shows the distribution of credible values for TCI.
