R (R Core Team 2017) is an open-source platform which makes available a library of packages that can be used and modified as necessary. R-studio provides a range of user-friendly features to facilitate interaction with R. The packages used are listed in the appendix: R packages used Table 4.1. All data, code and outputs are stored in R:/IST/SRC/MonSurv/MERF/DocWorksp/RC/projects/fpTrees. 2.4 Model Trend in mTCI was analysed using a Bayesian generalised linear mixed model. The analysis was run using the rstanarm package (Stan Development Team 2016) in R (R Core Team 2017). Transect was treated as a random effect in the analysis. Each tree was then assumed to provide an independent data point for the analysis. A time field was generated as \\(time = min(Year) + (max(Year) - min(Year))/2\\). The model specification was: \\[mTCI ~ time * Species * HydroGp + (1 | Transect)\\] 2.5 Trees There were 3215 trees available for analysis (see table below). The distribution of these trees on the Katarapko floodplain is shown in Figure 2.1. Figure 2.1: Tree locations on Katarapko floodplain References "],

Ideally these residuals will show no pattern - i.e. randomly distributed about zero. However, in this case, at low values of mTCI the model is under-predicting (negative residuals) while at high values the model is over-predicting (positive residuals). Figure 3.1: Residuals 3.1.2 Model fit Figure 3.2 shows how a subset of the model runs (light blue lines) fits to the original data (dark blue line). Figure 3.2: Model fit 3.2 mTCI Table 3.1 shows median credible estimates for mTCI. Table 3.2 shows the 95% credible interval range for mTCI. Figure 3.3 shows the distribution of credible values for mTCI.
